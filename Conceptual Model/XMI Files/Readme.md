This folder contains XMI files exported from the CityGML 3.0 conceptual model (UML model) using Enterprise Architect version 14.
This includes
- a single XMI file version with all CityGML 3.0 packages integrated but no references
- a per-package collection of XMI files for each package in the CityGML 3.0 UML model
- XMI files for the ISO TC211 and OASIS references
- a single (large) XMI file with CityGML 3.0 UML model plus the ISO TC211 and OASIS references

Note that the single file with references by itself contains the entire normative UML model for CityGML 3.0. The separated files are for the convenience of persons needing only those specific parts of the model.
