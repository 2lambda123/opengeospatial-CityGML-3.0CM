CityGML-3.0
===========

Public repository for the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) CityGML SWG development of version 3.0 of the CityGML standard in cooperation with SIG 3D and Buiding Smart International.

**Workflow:**

The CityGML SWG is large and has many members with an interest in specific topics. The SWG’s CityGML 3.0 development process recognizes the diversity of member interests and the value of specialization with a new (to OGC) structure. We have structured twenty-one issues derived from the existing change requests, results of the past four SWG meetings, and the workshop in Munich last summer as “work packages (WPs).” Each WP has a simple scope, identified participants, and in most cases a designated leader. WP breakout groups will work as much as possible in parallel between now and March 2015. During this time, the WPs will periodically report back to the whole SWG on issues and progress. In March 2015 the WPs will formally submit their products as OGC CRs directed to the CityGML SWG.
 
Two WPs (UML Editor and Standard Editor) have an editing and integration role. The SWG is considering grouping the work packages into a smaller number of chunks where there are either interdependencies, common participants, or both. The grouping will probably be approved and we expect to have about ten specialist WPs plus the two Editors after our next meeting in mid-February.)
 
**GitHub Private Repo:**

GitHub enables parallel work by allowing the WPs to fork their own branch of the UML model and standard document, record their work as change sets, and ultimately submit the changes back to the Editors for merge. Starting in March 2015, we are planning six months of full SWG work for the final merge, though we hope that the work is actually done incrementally during the year and one-half 3.0 development cycle to avoid a “big bang” effect at the end. This use of GitHub is in a private repository, accessible to the SWG, SIG 3D, and possible external experts identified, agreed to by the SWG, and admitted with an executed observer agreement as you describe.
 
**Outreach:**

Independently, the SWG intends to expose some results via GitHub during the course of the development cycle to get external review, much as we did during GeoPackage 1.0. This may best be done via a second public repository with a slightly different URL such as  http://www.github.com/opengeospatial/CityGML-3.0 (and then the private one could be as  http://www.github.com/opengeospatial/CityGML-3.0-SWG . That’s a technical issue.
 
We are actively looking for external expertise via the CFP developed by Claus Nagel and we have a tentative plan to have a second OGC-SIG 3D public workshop hosted by Fraunhofer in Darmstadt this summer or early autumn.
